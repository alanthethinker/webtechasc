            <h1>My hobbies</h1>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy staying active with Brazilian jiu-jitsu and hiking, which challenge me both physically and mentally. I'm also passionate about coding, where I love solving complex problems and creating solutions. 
            When I need to unwind, I dive into video games or music, which fuel my love for creativeness and motivate me to move forward.</p>
